# AdventureBookApp
===================

In the 1970s and 1980s Choose Your Own Adventure books were very popular. They were paperback novels which had fragments of stories of scattered across pages. On the bottom of each page was a choice or an ending. Once you read the fragment which often projected you into a mystical world fraught with peril, you could choose what you could do next. This was done by giving you a list of choices with page numbers. You would then navigate to that page and carry on your adventure.
